				<div class="alberteinstein headings">Albert Einstein</div>
				<div class="info">Albert Einstein(1879-1955) was a German mathematician and physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. His work also had a major impact on the development of atomic energy. In his later years, Einstein focused on unified field theory.He also had what were considered speech challenges, though he developed a passion for classical music and playing the violin, which would stay with him into his later years.</div>

				<div class="nikolatesla headings">Nikola Tesla</div>
				<div class="info">Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla(1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the production, transmission and application of electric power. He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor and developed AC generation and transmission technology.Tesla studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz. In 1882, while on a walk, he came up with the idea for a brushless AC motor, making the first sketches of its rotating electromagnets in the sand of the path.</div>

				<div class="stephenhawkings headings">Stephen Hawkings</div>
				<div class="info">Stephen Hawking was born in Oxford, England on January 8, 1942. At the age of 17, he enrolled at University College, Oxford. He wanted to study mathematics, but resorted to the study of physics.In 1970, Dr. Hawking began work on the characteristics of black holes. As a result of his research, it was predicted that black holes emit radiation in the X-ray to gamma-ray range of the spectrum. In the 1980s, he returned to an earlier interest in the origins of the universe and how quantum mechanics may affect its fate. </div>
